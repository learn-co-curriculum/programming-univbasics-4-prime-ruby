# Implementing Prime

## Learning Goals

- Define methods and controlling return values
- Use iteration and looping

## Introduction

We're going to create our own `prime?()` method. This lab will challenge you to
do a little research to see what options are available to create this method
without using Ruby's libraries.

Do not use any other Ruby library. You must build a method that can verify
whether a number is prime. Don't `require 'math'` and just piggyback off their
implementation of prime number.

Fork and clone this repository. Run the test suite to learn what is required of
you.

## Define Methods and Controlling Return Values

Define a method, `prime?()`, that takes in an integer argument and returns a
boolean of whether or not that integer is a prime number.

## Use Iteration and Looping

Think about what defines an integer as a prime number. Research algorithms to
find out how to determine if a number is prime. Use a range of numbers in an array
and iterate through it.

You can look into [benchmarking in Ruby](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2013/06/19/how-do-i-benchmark-ruby-code/)
and profile a few different approaches to implementing `prime ()`.

## Conclusion

Learning how to create our own methods makes us faster and more efficient. This
language-indiscriminate exercise will help us become more proficient programmers
that aren't depending on Ruby's libraries.
